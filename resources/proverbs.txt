Confess and be hanged
Conscience makes cowards of us all

Credit won by lying is quick in dying
Curiosity killed the cat; Satisfaction brought it back
Curses, like chickens come home to roost

Deeds are fruits, words are but leaves
Desperate diseases must have desperate remedies
Diamonds are forever
Different strokes for different folks
Diligence is the mother of good luck
Discretion is the better part of valour

Do unto others as you would have them do to you
Don't advertise: Tell it to a gossip

Don't count your chickens before they hatch

Empty barrels make the most noise
Empty vessels make the most noise
Empty vessels make the most sound
Enough is as good as a feast
Every cloud has a silver lining
Every dog has its day

Everybody must row with the oars he has
Everything has an end

Give credit where credit is due
Give them an inch and they'll take a mile
Good company on the road is the shortest cut
Good judgement comes from experience, experience comes from bad judgement
Good wine ruins the purse, and bad wine ruins the stomach
Gossips are frogs, they drink and talk
Greediness burst the bag

Grow angry slowly; there's plenty of time
Growing old is inevitable; growing up is optional
Grumbling makes the loaf no larger
Half a loaf is better than none
Hard work never did anyone any harm
Hasty climbers have sudden falls
Hasty judgements are generally faulty
Hatred is as blind as love
He bears misery best that hides it most
He has enough who is content
He is rich that is satisfied
He that hurts another, hurts himself
He that pays last never pays twice
He who does nothing, does not damage anything
He who drinks a little too much drinks much too much
He who fights and runs away, lives to fight another day
He who hesitates is lost
He who laughs last, laughs longest
He who rises late must trot all day

He who won't be advised, can't be helped
He who wronged you will hate you
Heavy givers are light complainers
His bark is louder than his bite
His eyes are bigger than his belly
Home is where the heart is
Honesty is the best policy
Honour is a gift you give yourself
Hope for the best and prepare for the worst
Hunger is the best sauce
I am rubber and you are glue, your words bounce off me and stick to you
If a job is worth doing it is worth doing well
If anything can go wrong, it will
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again
If it is not broken, don't fix it
If the cap fits, wear it
If wishes were horses, beggars would ride
If you can't help, don't hinder
If you don't know where you're going, then the journey is never ending
If you don't say it you will not have to unsay it
If you lie down with dogs, you'll get up with fleas
If you lose your temper, don't look for it
If you see something you like, take it and make it better
In for a penny, in for a pound
In one ear and out the other
In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king
Innocent as a new born babe
Is fair and wise and good and gay
It can't happen here is number one on the list of famous last words
It is better to be born lucky than rich
It is better to be green and growing than ripe and rotten
It is easier to destroy than to build
It is easy to criticise others work, when you are not working
It is hard to soar like an eagle when surrounded by turkeys
It is no use crying over spilt milk
It is the first step that is difficult
It is too late closing the gate after the horse has bolted
It never rains but it pours
It takes two to have an argument
It's a poor job that can't carry one boss
It's all in a days work
It's an ill bird that fouls its own nest
It's an ill wind that blows no-one some good
It's an old dog for a hard road
It's either all or nothing
It's no use closing the stable door, after the horse has bolted
It's not over till it's over
Joy shared is double joy; grief shared is half grief
Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open
Kill two birds with the one stone
Laugh and the world laughs with you, cry and you cry alone
Laziness travels so slowly that poverty soon overtakes it
Least talk most work
Leave no stone unturned
Leave tomorrow till tomorrow
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let the buyer beware
Life begins at forty
Life's trials may be hard to bear, but patience can outlive them
Like a fish out of water
Like looking for a needle in a haystack
Listen to the pot calling the kettle black
Little and often fill the purse
Little strokes fell great oaks
Little thieves are hanged, but great ones escape
Look before you leap
Lost time is never found again
Love and a cough cannot be hid
Love does much but money does all
Love levels all inequalities
Love makes a good eye squint
Love sought is good, but given unsought is better
Love to live and live to love
Love with life is heaven; and life unloving, hell
Make hay while the sun shines
Man is the head but woman turns it
Manners maketh the man
Many a true word spoken in jest
Many drops make a shower
Many hands make light work
Marry in haste, repent at leisure
Memory is the treasure of the mind
Mighty oaks from tiny acorns grow
Milk the cow but don't pull off the udder
Money burns a hole in your pocket
Money doesn't grow on trees
More haste less speed
Necessity is a hard nurse, but she raises strong children
Necessity is the mother of invention
Needs must when the devil drives
Negotiation is preferable to confrontation
Never cackle unless you lay
Never let the sun go down on your anger
Never let the sun set on angry heart
Never let the sun set on thy wrath
Never look a gift horse in the mouth
Never put off 'til tomorrow what you can do today
Never quarrel with one's bread and butter
Never spend your money before you have it
Never test the depth of the water with both feet
No life can be dreary when work is a delight
No man is worse for knowing the worst of himself
No man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who is, won't make you cry
No news is good news
No one can be caught in places he does not visit
No point in making a mountain out of a molehill
No sense closing the barn door after the horse has bolted
No wise man ever wishes to be younger
Nobody can serve two masters
Not in a month of Sundays
Not to break is better than to mend
Nothing dries sooner than a tear
Nothing falls into the mouth of a sleeping fox
Nothing is ill said if it is not ill taken
Oaks may fall when reeds take the storm
Old friends and old wine are best
On a long journey even a straw is heavy
One can win a rat race and still be a rat
One day a rooster, the next day a feather duster
One false move may lose the game
One man's junk is another man's treasure
One man's loss, is another man's gain
One man's meat is another man's poison
One of these days is none of these days
One picture is worth a thousand words
One today is worth two tomorrows
Only desire what you deserve
Only the good die young
Open confession is good for the soul
Out of sight, out of mind
Out of the frying pan into the fire
Patience is a virtue
Peace begins just where ambition ends
Penny wise, pound foolish
People who living in glass houses should not throw stones
Persuasion is better than force
Plan for the worst; hope for the best
Possession is nine tenths of the law
Pride cometh before a fall
Procrastination is the thief of time
Putting the cart before the horse
Ready money is ready medicine
Red sky at night, sailors delight, red sky in the morning, sailors take warning
Red sky at night, shepherds delight, red sky in the morning, shepherds warning
Rome wasn't built in a day
Rules are made to be broken
Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander
Say what you mean and mean what you say
See nothing, say nothing, know nothing
Self praise is no recommendation
Shake the hand before you plough the field
Show a clean pair of heels
Silence is an excellent remedy against slander
Silence is less injurious than a bad reply
Since before cocky was an egg
Slow and steady wins the race
Small faults indulged let in greater
Some of the best gifts come in small packages
Some roads aren't meant to be travelled alone
Spare the rod and spoil the child
Speak clearly, if you speak at all
Step by step one goes far
Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me
Still waters run deep
Stop beating around the bush
Strike while the iron's hot
Successful people are persistent
Take care of the pence and the pounds will take care of themselves
Take your wife's first advice
Talking comes by nature, silence by wisdom
Temper is so good a thing that we should never lose it
The Lord loveth a cheerful liar
The beaten path is safest
The best cast at dice is not to play
The best ground bears weeds as well as flowers
The best of friends must part
The best things are not bought and sold
The best things in life are free
The bigger they are the harder they fall
The course of love never did run smooth
The customer is always right
The darkest hour is before the dawn
The darkest night brings the brightest dawn
The devil finds work for idle hands
The early bird catches the worm
The family that prays together, stays together
The fool wanders, the wise man travels
The gods help them that help themselves
The golden age never was the present one
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence
The greater joy is in giving - not receiving
The harder you work, the luckier you are
The hardest part is leaving home
The hardest work is to do nothing
The hood does not make the monk
The leopard does not change his spots
The longer you live the more you see
The longest journey begins with the first step
The longest way round is the sweetest way home
The love of money is the root of all evil
The meek shall inherit the earth
The more you stir, the more it stinks
The nearer the bone the sweeter the meat
The only time you should be late is for your own funeral
The pen is mightier than the sword
The proof of the pudding is in the eating
The receiver is as bad as the thief
The sleepy fox catches no chickens
The sun shines on both sides of the hedge
The wise man is deceived once but the fool twice
The wise shall understand
The worst wheel always creaks most
There is a thin line between love and hate
There is no better looking-glass than an old friend
There is no fool like an old fool
There is no honour among thieves
There is nothing as sharp as a woman's tongue
There's always one rotten apple in every box
There's many a slip, twixt cup and the lip
There's no use in flogging a dead horse
Think thrice, measure twice, cut once
Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it
Those who never do anything never make mistakes
To add insult to injury
To eat one's heart out
To err is human, to forgive divine
To look as if butter will not melt in his mouth
To promise yourself a future means to rob yourself of the present
To scare a bird is not the way to catch it
To the world you may be one person, but to one person, you may be the world
To wait and be patient soothes many a pang
Tomorrow is a new day
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Too many irons in the fire
True beauty lies within
Two cannot fall out if one does not choose
Two heads are better than one
Up and down like a fiddler's elbow
Use not today what tomorrow will need
Useless as a screen door on a dunny
We cannot erase the sad records from our past
We do not always gain by changing
What can't be cured must be endured
What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger
What the eye doesn't see, the heart doesn't grieve over
What you eat today walks and talks tomorrow
When a fox hears a rabbit screaming it comes running, but not to help
When dew is on the grass, no rain will come to pass
Where observation is concerned, chance favours only the prepared mind
Where there's a will there's a way
Where there's smoke there's fire
While the cats away the mice play
While there's life there's hope
Wisdom is better than strength
Wisdom is neither inheritance nor a legacy
Wisdom is the wealth of the wise
Wise it is to comprehend the whole
Wondrous is the strength of cheerfulness
Work as if everything depends on me, but pray as if everything depends on God
You are what you eat
You can eat an elephant if you do it one mouthful at a time
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink
You can't buy a racehorse for the price of a donkey
You can't get blood out of a stone
You can't have your cake and eat it too
You can't live on bread alone
You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear
You can't put an old head on young shoulders
You can't tell a book by its cover
You can't unscramble a scrambled egg
You cannot lose what you never had
You have to crawl before you walk
You made your bed, now you must lie in it
You never know what you can do till you try
